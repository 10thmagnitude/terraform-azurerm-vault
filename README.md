# Vault Azure Module

This is a fork of Gruntwork's https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-azurerm-vault.

I believe this is a little simpler (i.e. no supervisor, only deal with systemd, leverage packer for a little more, etc.).
I know it is opinionated, but I like it.

I hope to update this readme with further detail soon.
